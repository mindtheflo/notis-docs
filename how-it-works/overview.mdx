# How Notis.ai Works

Notis.ai is your personal voice-powered assistant that helps you capture, organize, and find information using just your voice. This page explains how Notis works behind the scenes to transform your voice messages into organized knowledge.

## Meet Your Personal Assistant

Notis.ai acts as your personal assistant, available through your favorite messaging platforms. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that require you to type or tap, Notis lets you simply speak your thoughts, tasks, and ideas.

## Privacy and Security

Notis.ai is designed with privacy and security as top priorities:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Your voice messages and data are encrypted in transit
- **Temporary Storage**: Voice recordings are processed and then deleted
- **Limited Access**: Only you can access your personal data
- **Transparent Permissions**: Clear explanation of what data Notis needs and why

## Behind the Scenes Example

Here's what happens when you send a voice message to Notis saying "Remind me to call John tomorrow at 2 PM":

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Voice Processing">
    Your voice message is received by Notis and securely sent to the speech recognition system, which converts it to the text: "Remind me to call John tomorrow at 2 PM"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="2. Intent Recognition">
    The NLU system identifies this as a reminder request and extracts:
    - Action: Set a reminder
    - Task: "call John"
    - Time: "tomorrow at 2 PM"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="3. Time Processing">
    The system calculates the exact date and time based on when you sent the message:
    - If today is April 10, "tomorrow at 2 PM" becomes April 11 at 14:00
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="4. Task Creation">
    Notis creates a reminder in your system with:
    - Title: "Call John"
    - Due date: April 11, 2025
    - Due time: 14:00
    - Status: Not completed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="5. Notion Integration">
    If connected, Notis adds this reminder to your designated Notion database
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="6. Confirmation">
    Notis sends you a message: "âœ… I've set a reminder for you to call John tomorrow (Apr 11) at 2:00 PM"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
