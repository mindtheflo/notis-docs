# Voice-to-Text Technology

Notis.ai's core functionality relies on advanced voice-to-text technology that accurately converts your spoken words into written text. This page explains how this technology works and how to get the best results.

## How Voice-to-Text Works

When you send a voice message to Notis, the following process occurs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audio Capture">
    Your voice message is captured through your messaging app (WhatsApp, Telegram, Email)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Audio Processing">
    The audio is preprocessed to enhance clarity, reduce noise, and optimize for transcription
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Speech Recognition">
    Advanced AI models analyze the audio patterns and convert them to text
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Language Processing">
    The text is processed to add proper punctuation, capitalization, and formatting
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Context Analysis">
    Notis analyzes the context to improve accuracy for domain-specific terms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Speak Clearly">

    - Articulate words clearly without overemphasizing
    - Avoid mumbling or trailing off at the end of sentences
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Minimize Background Noise">
    - Record in a quiet environment when possible
    - Avoid areas with echoes or reverberations
    - Hold your device at an appropriate distance (not too close or too far)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Structure Your Message">
    - Start with a clear command or context (e.g., "Take a note about..." or "Remind me to...")
    - Pause briefly between different thoughts or sections
    - Mention important names or technical terms clearly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Commands and Keywords">
    - Begin with clear commands like "Take a note," "Set a reminder," or "Add to my task list"
    - Include date and time information clearly for scheduling (e.g., "tomorrow at 3 PM")
    - Use keywords that help Notis categorize your content
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Handling Transcription Errors

If Notis doesn't transcribe your message correctly:

1. **Send a correction**: Reply with "Correct that to: [correct text]"
2. **Try again**: Record a new message speaking more clearly
3. **Type instead**: For critical information, you can always type your message
4. **Teach Notis**: For recurring terms, you can teach Notis specific words using "Learn this term: [term]"
