# Managing Your Subscription

This guide explains how to manage your Notis.ai subscription, including viewing your current plan, updating payment methods, and canceling if needed.

## Accessing Your Subscription Portal

Notis.ai uses Stripe for secure and simplified billing. To manage your subscription:

1. Ask Notis to manage/cancel your subscription by sending a message like "manage subscription" or "cancel subscription"
2. Notis will provide you with the Stripe portal link: [https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/3cs3e95a76jl1pe144](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/3cs3e95a76jl1pe144)
3. Click the link to access your subscription management portal

Alternatively, you can directly access the portal using the link above.

## Subscription Portal Overview

The Stripe portal interface will vary depending on whether you have an active subscription:
