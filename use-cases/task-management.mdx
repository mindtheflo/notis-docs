## Task Management Best Practices with Notis

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Capture Immediately">
    Use Notis's voice interface to capture tasks the moment they come to mind, before you forget them. The low friction of voice input makes this especially effective.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Create clear, actionable tasks that specify exactly what needs to be done. Instead of "Website," say "Draft content for About page on website."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Due Dates Strategically">
    Only add due dates to tasks that truly have deadlines. For other tasks, use priority levels to indicate importance without creating false urgency.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Regularly">
    Schedule regular reviews of your task list (daily, weekly) to stay on top of your responsibilities and adjust priorities as needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
