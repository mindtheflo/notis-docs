## Note-Taking Workflows with Notis

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture">
    Record thoughts and information as they come to you using voice messages
    
    **Example**: During a meeting, send a voice message: "Note: Client wants to revise the timeline and add a new feature to the scope. We need to adjust the budget accordingly."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Process">
    Notis transcribes, categorizes, and stores your note in your Second Brain system
    
    **Example**: The note is transcribed, tagged with #client-meeting and #project-x, and added to your Notion database
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Organize">
    Review and refine your notes periodically
    
    **Example**: Later, you ask Notis: "Show my notes from today's client meeting" and then "Add to note about timeline: Need to discuss with development team"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use">
    Retrieve and apply the information when needed
    
    **Example**: Before your next meeting, you ask: "Search notes about client timeline changes"
  </Step>

## Note-Taking Best Practices with Notis

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Capture Without Filtering">
    Don't worry about organization during capture. Just speak your thoughts naturally and let Notis handle the organization. The goal is to get ideas out of your head quickly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Clear Titles">
    Start your notes with a clear, descriptive title that will help you identify the content later. For example, "Meeting with Marketing Team: Q2 Campaign Planning" is better than just "Marketing Meeting."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Context">
    Add relevant context to your notes, such as dates, people involved, projects, or events. This makes them easier to find and understand later.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review and Refine">
    Schedule regular time to review your notes, connect related ideas, and extract action items. This turns raw notes into valuable knowledge.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
