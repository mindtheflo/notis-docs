## Meeting Minutes Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prepare Structure in Advance">
    Create a meeting template or agenda before the meeting starts. This provides a framework for capturing notes and ensures you don't miss important topics.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Capture Key Points, Not Everything">
    Focus on recording important discussions, decisions, and action items rather than trying to transcribe everything verbatim. Notis can help identify the most relevant information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clearly Mark Action Items">
    Always use the specific action item format to ensure tasks are properly tracked. Include the responsible person, clear description, and deadline when possible.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Distribute Promptly">
    Share meeting notes as soon as possible after the meeting while the discussion is still fresh in participants' minds. This allows for corrections and clarifications.
