## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    The more specific your query, the better the results. Instead of "climate change," try "economic impacts of climate change on coastal communities in the next decade."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Follow-up Questions">
    Refine your search through follow-up questions rather than starting a new search each time. This maintains context and provides more relevant information.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Verify Information">
    Always check the sources provided with search results, especially for important or controversial topics. Request additional sources if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Organize Search Results">
    Develop a system for organizing saved search results in Notion, such as using consistent tags or dedicated databases for different research topics.
  </Accordion>
