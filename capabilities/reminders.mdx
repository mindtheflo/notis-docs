## Tips for Effective Reminders

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Create clear, actionable reminders that specify exactly what needs to be done. Instead of "Reminder: project," say "Reminder: submit first draft of project report."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Time Contexts">
    Specify time contexts for more natural reminders:
    - "Remind me tomorrow morning to call the dentist"
    - "Remind me this evening to start the laundry"
    - "Remind me next week to follow up on the proposal"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Group Related Reminders">
    Use categories or projects to group related reminders:
    - "Remind me to prepare agenda, book meeting room, and send invites for tomorrow's meeting #quarterly-review"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Reminders in the Moment">
    When you think of something you need to do later, set a reminder immediately using voice commands to capture it before you forget.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
