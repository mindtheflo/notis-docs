- Organized with tags and categories
- Linked to related notes and projects
- Used in documents and pages

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    The more detailed your description, the better the result. Include information about subject, style, mood, lighting, and composition.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use References">
    Referring to known styles, artists, or media types helps create more predictable results: "like a Wes Anderson film" or "in the style of art deco posters."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Iterate">
    Don't expect perfect results on the first try. Use the variation and refinement commands to improve your images incrementally.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Organize">
    Develop a system for organizing your generated images in Notion, such as using consistent tags or dedicated galleries for different projects.
