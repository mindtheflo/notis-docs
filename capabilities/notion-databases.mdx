  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Information Flows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Voice Input">
    You send a voice message to Notis through WhatsApp, Telegram, or Email
    
    **Example**: "Take a note about the marketing campaign ideas we discussed yesterday"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Processing">
    Notis transcribes your message, identifies the intent, and extracts key information
    
    **Example**: Identifies this as a note about "marketing campaign ideas" with a reference to a previous discussion
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Database Selection">
    Notis determines which Notion database to use based on the content type and your settings
    
    **Example**: Selects your "Notes" database since this is note content
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Property Mapping">
    Information is mapped to the appropriate database properties
    
    **Example**: 
    - Title: "Marketing Campaign Ideas"
    - Content: The transcribed note
    - Tags: "Marketing" (automatically detected)
    - Date: Current date
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Creation in Notion">
    A new entry is created in your Notion database with all the mapped properties
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Notis sends you a confirmation with a link to the newly created Notion page
    
    **Example**: "âœ… I've added your note about Marketing Campaign Ideas to your Notes database. [View in Notion]"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Database Templates

Notis provides pre-configured templates for common use cases:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Task Management"
    icon="list-check"
  >
    A database optimized for tracking tasks with status, priority, due dates, and categories
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Notes Collection"
    icon="note-sticky"
  >
    A flexible database for storing and organizing all types of notes with rich text and tagging
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Meeting Notes"
    icon="users"
  >
    Specialized for capturing meeting minutes with attendees, action items, and decisions
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="Project Tracker"
    icon="diagram-project"
  >
    Track projects with milestones, status updates, team members, and related resources
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

To use a template:
1. Send "Create new database using [template name] template"
2. Notis will create the database in your Notion workspace
3. Set it as your default for the relevant content type

## Advanced Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Relation Properties">
    Notis can maintain relationships between items in different databases:
    
    - "Add this note to Project X" (creates a relation to the project)
    - "Link task to meeting notes from yesterday"
    - "Show all notes related to Project X"
    
    This helps maintain connections between related pieces of information across your knowledge system.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Database Views">
    Access different views of your Notion databases through Notis:
    
    - "Show my tasks in Kanban view"
    - "Show calendar view for next month"
    - "Show completed tasks from last week"
    
    Notis will provide a link to the specific view in Notion.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Formulas and Rollups">
    Notis respects and works with Notion's formula and rollup properties:
    
    - Formulas automatically calculate values based on other properties
    - Rollups aggregate information from related items
    - Notis will include these calculated values when reporting information
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk Operations">
    Perform operations on multiple database items at once:
    
    - "Mark all overdue tasks as high priority"
    - "Move all notes about marketing to the Marketing project"
    - "Show all incomplete tasks across all projects"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consistent Database Structure">
    Maintain consistent property names and types across similar databases to help Notis correctly map information. For example, always use "Due Date" rather than sometimes using "Deadline" or "Due By."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Tags/Categories">
    Implement a tagging system in your databases and mention these tags when creating content through Notis. For example: "Note about client feedback #project-x #client-feedback"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular Database Maintenance">
    Periodically review and clean up your databases to remove duplicate entries, update outdated information, and archive completed items.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Template Pages">
    Create template pages in Notion for recurring content types, then tell Notis to use them: "Create new meeting note using the Weekly Team Meeting template"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Issues">
    If Notis can't connect to your Notion workspace:
    
    1. Check that your Notion account is active and accessible
    2. Verify that Notis still has the necessary permissions
    3. Try reconnecting: "Reconnect Notion"
    4. Check if you've reached API rate limits (rare but possible)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Content Not Appearing">
    If your content isn't showing up in Notion:
    
    1. Verify you're using the correct database name
    2. Check that the database has the necessary properties
    3. Ensure you haven't reached any Notion limits
    4. Try a simple test: "Create test note in [database name]"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Property Mapping Problems">
    If properties aren't mapping correctly:
    
    1. Check that property names match what Notis expects
    2. Verify property types are compatible (e.g., date properties for due dates)
    3. Try remapping: "Remap properties for Tasks database"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission Errors">
    If you see permission errors:
    
    1. Make sure Notis has access to the specific database
    2. Check if the database is in a workspace Notis can access
    3. Verify you haven't revoked Notis's permissions
    4. Try reconnecting with full permissions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
