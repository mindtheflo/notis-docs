# Notis Second Brain System

The Notis Second Brain System is a powerful knowledge management framework that helps you capture, organize, and retrieve information effortlessly. This system works seamlessly with your voice inputs to create a personalized knowledge base.

## What is a Second Brain?

A "Second Brain" is an external, digital system that helps you store and organize information outside your biological brain. It serves as an extension of your thinking, allowing you to:

- Capture ideas and information without forgetting
- Organize knowledge in a way that makes sense to you
- Find information quickly when you need it
- Make connections between different pieces of information

To get the most out of your Notis Second Brain:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Capture Everything">
    Don't filter or judge information as it comes in. Capture all potentially useful ideas, tasks, and notes. Notis makes it easy to capture without friction, so you can decide what's valuable later.

    Mention categories or add hashtags in your voice messages to help Notis organize information more effectively. For example: "Note about marketing strategy #work #q2planning"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review Regularly">
    Schedule time to review and refine your Second Brain. This helps you process information, make connections, and ensure nothing important falls through the cracks.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Create Projects for Related Information">
    Group related notes, tasks, and resources into projects in Notion to maintain context and see the big picture of your work and ideas.
